          record such names but should not be used to record translations of the
          primary legal name. Where more than one legal name exists and where
          they have equal standing but are expressed in different languages,
          identify the language used in each of the multiple legal names. It is
          notable that some jurisdictions regard the use of any name other than

          jurisdictions, a business will have one or more tax numbers associated
          with them which do not, by themselves, confer legal entity status. The
          Identifier property must not be used to link to the identifier issued
          by the authority that conferred legal entity status on a business.
